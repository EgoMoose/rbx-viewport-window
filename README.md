# rbx-viewport-window

Huge shout-out to [EmilyBendsSpace](https://x.com/EmilyBendsSpace) as their work is instrumental in ViewportWindows.

ViewportWindow provides developers with the tools to use viewport frames much like you'd use a window in real life. You can look into them and see a different space that is contained in a viewport frame. This can be used to do some neat stuff like non euclidean geometry.

This repository is split into two parts:
- `src` contains the code for ViewportWindow. 
- `demo` contains a couple of examples for using ViewportWindow.

You can build the demo with:

```
rojo build demo.project.json --output demo.rbxl
```
